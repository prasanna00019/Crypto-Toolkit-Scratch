## 🚧 Work in Progress

- 🔄 Currently working on **SHA-3** (Keccak-based)
- 🧪 Will be adding more hashing and encryption algorithms in the future, including:
  - Whirlpool
  - Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
  and many more as I research and experiment ... 
---

## 🛠️ Purpose

This project is:
- Built **from scratch** with no cryptographic libraries
- Designed for **learning and exploration**
- Meant to **demystify** how cryptographic primitives work

---

## 💡 Usage

All implementations are in pure Python and organized by algorithm. Example usage and testing can be found in respective directories or test files.
