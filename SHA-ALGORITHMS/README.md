## üìö How It Works

### General Workflow
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Pads the input message and encodes its length.
   - Prepares the message for block-wise processing.
2. **Message Scheduling**:
   - Expands the message into words for processing.
   - The number of words and their size depend on the specific SHA variant.
3. **Compression**:
   - Processes each block through a series of rounds using SHA-specific transformations.
4. **Final Hash**:
   - Concatenates and formats the resulting hash values.

### Salted Hashing (SHA-224)
- Random salts are generated and dynamically mixed into the hash.
- Utilities are provided for extracting and verifying salted hashes.

## üìù Example Usage

### Text Hashing
- **SHA-1**:
  ```python
  print(generalized_SHA1("Your message here"))
  ```
- **SHA-256**:
  ```python
  print(generalized_SHA256("hello world"))
  # Output: b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9
  ```
- **SHA-512/256**:
  ```python
  print(generalized_SHA512_256("your message here"))
  ```

### Salted Hashing (SHA-224)
- **Generate Salted Hash**:
  ```python
  hashed_output, used_salt = generalized_SHA224_salt("your message here")
  print("Salted Hash:", hashed_output)
  print("Salt Used:", used_salt)
  ```
- **Verify Salted Hash**:
  ```python
  is_valid = compare_hash("your message here", hashed_output)
  print("Is Valid?", is_valid)
  ```
