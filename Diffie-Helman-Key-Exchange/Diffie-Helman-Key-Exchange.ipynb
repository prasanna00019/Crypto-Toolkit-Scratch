    "# 🔐 Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates the **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange** algorithm, implemented from scratch in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The code showcases how two parties (Alice and Bob) can securely generate a shared secret key over an insecure channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prime Number Generation:** Uses `sympy` to generate large prime numbers.\n",
    "- **Modular Exponentiation:** Efficient exponentiation by squaring.\n",
    "- **Step-by-Step Key Exchange:** Functions for Alice and Bob to compute their public and shared keys.\n",
    "- **Educational:** Clear, well-documented code for learning and experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prime and Generator Selection:**  \n",
    "    Large prime `p` and generator `g` are chosen.\n",
    "2. **Key Generation:**  \n",
    "    - Alice and Bob each select a private key.\n",
    "    - They compute their public keys using modular exponentiation.\n",
    "3. **Key Exchange:**  \n",
    "    - Alice and Bob exchange public keys.\n",
    "    - Both compute the shared secret using the other's public key and their own private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.x\n",
    "- [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the notebook cells in order to see the key exchange in action. You can modify the private keys or use larger primes for experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✨ Built From Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "All cryptographic logic and key exchange steps are implemented manually, without relying on external cryptography libraries.\n",
    "\n",
